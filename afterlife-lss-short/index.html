<p>Oh right, LSS does not exist anymore. Then it means, this world will be forgotten and removed soon. Don’t feel bad, it’s only a branch after all! Read <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://xiaogenintendo.github.io/2020/10/21/how-to-know-oc/">Further Reading: How to know my OC</a> first, won’t you?</p>
<h1 id="ONE"><a href="#ONE" class="headerlink" title="ONE"></a>ONE</h1><blockquote>
<p>The wheels of fortune,</p>
<p>going round and round.</p>
<p>Carrying greetings and farewells, happiness and sorrow, birth and death.</p>
<p>When it halts finally,</p>
<p>Everything will be silence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>……</p>
<p>No one knows why, no one knows how, but Ninetail is dead. There’s a rumor saying that she was murdered. But no one can confirm it anymore.</p>
<p>“…… As the most beloved maid for Miss Ninetail. I feel extremely guilty and sad. I can’t protect her.”</p>
<p>“However, as she always have told me: I have to live on my own. So, in order to follow her after-death order, I, Hikari are determined to live independently!” </p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>That’s Hikari. She speaks with eyes of fire of enthusiastic and a holding fist. Unlike those weak creatures like Ookami, XGN and Doragon, she seems not to be dropping any tears, even not a sense of sadness. Maybe that’s how she was trained as a maid at the first place?</p>
<p>“Hikari, that’s optimistic of you to say that~ I was moved by that speech.” said XGN, sobbing quietly, “I believe you can do it! You are PROFESSIONAL, after all!”</p>
<p>“Believe me! I will still treat you like my ex-master!”</p>
<p>Wagging her tail, pointing out her fingers at XGN, smiling as her, this is our adorable and affectionate Hikari.</p>
<h1 id="TWO"><a href="#TWO" class="headerlink" title="TWO"></a>TWO</h1><p>House.</p>
<p><em>Ring, ring</em></p>
<p><em>Knock, knock</em></p>
<p>“Master XGN, it’s time to get up~ Time for a new school day~” Behind the doors was the gentle voice of Hikari. It’s not hard to imagine a dragon in its human form knocking with a big smile.</p>
<p>“Today’s breakfast is sweet bean bread and my speciality, cheese cake!”</p>
<p>On the table there were glasses of milk with a little steam coming out, golden brown bread with porcelain plates holding perfect and charming cakes. What’s more, a glorious red sheet was holding all of these things, making it more appetizing.</p>
<p>“Wow! That’s, that’s, far more than LUXURIOUS!” shouted Doragon.</p>
<p>“It tastes good too!”</p>
<p>“Hey! Don’t eat so fast!”</p>
<p>“How much time does it take to make all these?”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“If Miss Ninetail were here, she would be really amazed at your food! I really hope she could enjoy this!” XGN looked at Hikari, who had been standing back waiting. He wanted to cheer her up, apparently.</p>
<p>“Thank you for appreciation!”</p>
<p>Thus, she watched XGN and his classmates left.</p>
<p>“So what shall I do now?” Hikari sat down, began combing her scales on tail, “When will Miss Ninetail be back?”</p>
<p>“So they REALLY thought Miss Ninetail died, how stupid.” giggled Hikari, “Don’t they realize that last time Miss Ninetail ‘died’, she returned only in 2 weeks? And, how could such a strong and god-like fox die with no clue?”</p>
<p>Outside, there was noise from cars, roaring down the street. Inside, there was our Hikari, sitting quietly.</p>
<h1 id="THREE"><a href="#THREE" class="headerlink" title="THREE"></a>THREE</h1><p>Kitchen.</p>
<p>“So, this should do it.” </p>
<p>After nicely covered the cake with aluminum foil, Hikari put it inside the fridge.</p>
<p>“If Miss Ninetail comes back early, she will be able to enjoy this food without waiting~”</p>
<p>“And, how about I clean the room for her? It will be a BIG surprise~”, giggled Hikari, again.</p>
<p>After a hour’s work or less, Ninetail’s room became as tidy as new, shining in the sunlight.</p>
<p>“Report: Miss Ninetail may be back in any minute, so I have to be ready! And I shall not let her friends down, or she will blame me when she comes back! Exp. Date: 12/19.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>“Maybe I should keep two cakes. Everyone needs to eat after all”</p>
<p>Hikari put another cake into the fridge.</p>
<p>“Today I will clear her wardrobe too!”</p>
<p>Passionate, lovely as her, this is our Hikari.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>One day, two days, three days. Then there was seven leaving and greeting.</p>
<p>Soon, the fridge was full of dim sum and desserts of different types. The house had been cleaned 10 or 100 times.</p>
<p>“Calm down, Hikari.. You are being TOO passionate. Don’t push yourself too hard.” said XGN with an embarassed face.</p>
<p>“OK… I will try not to overdo it… I will only do what you say from now on.”</p>
<p>Two weeks, three weeks, and Christmas came. However, there was no symbol that Ninetail would be back.</p>
<p>The cakes in fridge had turned bad, there was dust covering Ninetail’s room again.</p>
<p>“Report: Nothing today. Exp. Date: 12/25”</p>
<p>“Report: Nothing today. Exp. Date: 12/26”</p>
<p>“Report: Nothing today. Exp. Date: 12/30”</p>
<p>“Report: Nothing today. Exp. Date: 1/1”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>This is our Hikari, who gets bored easily for doing nothing.</p>
<h1 id="FOUR"><a href="#FOUR" class="headerlink" title="FOUR"></a>FOUR</h1><p>It’s 1st Jan finally.</p>
<p>Living room.</p>
<p>“Hey! Do you have any questions to ask me today? I can PREDICT your future and fortune for the next year! But one question only, OK?” said XGN proudly.</p>
<p>XGN knows almost everything that happened in the past and would take place in the future.</p>
<p>“When will Miss Ninetail be back?” whispered Hikari to XGN. She wasn’t that enthusiastic and happy as December now, it seemed.</p>
<p>“Hasn’t she passed away, about 1 month ago? You should know that.”</p>
<p>“Oh..? Aren’t you pretendi..? Sorry… Thank you very much.” </p>
<p>Hikari gave XGN a big hug, nearly making him suffocate.</p>
<h1 id="FIVE"><a href="#FIVE" class="headerlink" title="FIVE"></a>FIVE</h1><p>Living Room. 2nd Jan.</p>
<p>“See you, my friends~”</p>
<p>“See you afternoon!”</p>
<p>Sighed, and again. After sending them off, Hikari opened the door which she hadn’t touched in half a month.</p>
<p>The bed made a very loud noise, but she climbed on. dipping feather in the ink, as she wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A contract can make a life.It can also leave a wanderer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She laid on bed, with a glass bottle in her hand.</p>
<p>“Sorry. This is farewell……? I hope it’s not……?”</p>
<p>This is our Hikari. Lying peacefully and silently, sparkling in the warm sunlight.</p>
<p>With an eternal smile as she, with a dream and goal like this, this is the greatest happiness one can have, in her standard.</p>
<p><strong>THE END OF CHAPTER AFTERLIFE</strong></p>
<h1 id="Some-murmur"><a href="#Some-murmur" class="headerlink" title="Some murmur"></a>Some murmur</h1><p>I hate writing stuff. They are really a waste of time.</p>
<p>This time, as always, I wrote something too common to be good. You have guessed its ending in the first chapter, haven’t you?</p>
<p>Ah, as for Hikari. She is a dragon heavily controlled and limited by the contract. To her, Ninetail was her whole purpose for life. Yes, she was born to be her maid. Knowing this, why not re-read the article again?</p>
<p>I won’t explain how Ninetail died. <del>I haven’t thought of it yet</del></p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you find this article very boring as much as I do.</p>
<p>BTW, have you played Ace Attorney 4? The poem, yes, you know it.</p>
<p>Damn, I want to sleep when writing this. I really want to make Hikari’s death longer and more fancy, but it turns out bad actually. Nice try.</p>
<h1 id="Quick-Q-and-A"><a href="#Quick-Q-and-A" class="headerlink" title="Quick Q and A"></a>Quick Q and A</h1><p>Q: Is Ninetail really dead?</p>
<p>A: Yes</p>
<p>Q: Is Hikari dead?</p>
<p>A: Yes</p>
<p>Q: Will we still be able to see them in future problems?</p>
<p>A: Yes</p>
<p>Q: You suck at English!</p>
<p>A: Yes</p>
<p>Q: What takes you so long to update this?</p>
<p>A: <em>Spice and Wolf</em></p>
<p>Q: You are such an animal!</p>
<p>A: Yes, as I want to be.</p>
<p>Q: Is Hikari really a dragon?</p>
<p>A: Yes</p>
<p>Q: Who are these bullshits??</p>
<p>A: Read the link over top.</p>
